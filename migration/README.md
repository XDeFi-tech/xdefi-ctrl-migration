# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```


### Gas Report
The gas report is generated by the `hardhat-gas-reporter` plugin. 
It provides a detailed breakdown of gas usage for each method in the contracts. 
The report includes the minimum, maximum, and average gas used for each method, the number of calls, and the average cost in USD. 
The report also includes the gas used for contract deployments and the average cost in USD. The report is generated using the `REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test` command.

To see results, open the [`gas-report.md`](gas-report.md).
