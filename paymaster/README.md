Aws lambda function for XDEFI to CTRL migration (http handler)
Relies on contract deployed from `../migration` folder

Also, lambda function relies on holders list json files from `data/holders` folder.
Those files being generated by means of `../xdefi-holder-snapshot`
If more up-to-date holders data required, please generate them via `../xdefi-holders-snapshot` command line and replace files in `data/holders` directory.

Basic function logic is following:

- Aceept and validate migration request
- Check whether given wallet address that requested migration is present on asset holders snapshot. Only addresses that present on holders snapthot or `migrationWhitelist.ts` are allowed to migrate gasless
- Check whether given holder has enough holding amount of given asset (XDEFI or vXDEFI) to migrate gasless
- Migrate gasless if all checks have passed
- Respond with transaction hash of a migration or error if checks was not passed or transaction failed
